# Linked Lists
With linked lists, your items can be anywhere in memory. Each item stores the address in memory of the next item in the list. This way a bunch of random memory addresses are linked together.

This means that adding to a linked list is easy! you put the item anywhere in memory and store the address to it with the previous item.

With linked lists you never have to move your items. Making them much better at inserts than arrays.
